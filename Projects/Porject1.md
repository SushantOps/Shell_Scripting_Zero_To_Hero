## We are running short on storage and as per the sys admin there are 25GB of blank files created by previous employees, 𝘄𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘀𝘂𝗰𝗵 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲𝘀.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Specify the directory where you want to search for zero-size files
directory="/path/to/directory"

# Use the find command to locate zero-size files in the specified directory
# and delete them using the rm command
find "$directory" -type f -size 0 -exec rm {} \;
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path to the directory where you want to search for and delete zero-size files.

This script uses the `find` command to locate all files (`-type f`) with a size of 0 bytes (`-size 0`) in the specified directory and its subdirectories. The `-exec` option is used to execute the `rm` command on each matching file to delete it.

After creating the script, you can make it executable using the `chmod` command:

```bash
chmod +x delete_empty_files.sh
```

Then, you can run the script to delete all zero-size files in the specified directory:

```bash
./delete_empty_files.sh
```
